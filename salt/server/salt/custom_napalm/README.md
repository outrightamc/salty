> Occassionally you may have a need that does not fit within one of Napalmâ€™s methods, nor will support ever be expected. As an example, if you wanted to build a parser to filter your unique banner and return structured data from it, you could extend the driver. The positive side effect is that tools such as Salt, Ansible, and Netbox implicitly have access to these methods.
